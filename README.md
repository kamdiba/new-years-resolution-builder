# New Year's Resolution Builder

A free, AI-powered tool that transforms vague New Year's intentions into actionable, achievable resolutions.

## The Problem

80% of New Year's resolutions fail by February. Why? Because "get healthier" or "advance my career" aren't plans—they're wishes.

Most resolutions fail because they lack:
- Specific, measurable goals
- Month-by-month action plans
- Accountability systems
- Obstacle planning

## The Solution

This tool guides you through a structured 20-30 minute conversation with 5 specialized AI "agents" who help you create a complete resolution blueprint.

## What You Get

By the end of the process, you'll have:

✨ **A Clear Vision** - What you truly want (not what you think you "should" want)

🎯 **Specific Goals** - Measurable targets with quarterly milestones

📅 **12-Month Action Plan** - Exactly what to do each month to achieve your goal

🛡️ **Accountability System** - Tracking methods, check-ins, and obstacle plans

📋 **Final Blueprint** - A comprehensive document you can reference all year

### Example Transformation

**Before:** "I want to get fit in 2026"

**After:** "I will lose 20 pounds by June 30, 2026 through:
- 4 weekly workouts (Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat at 6am)
- Daily food tracking in MyFitnessPal
- Weekly accountability check-ins with Sarah
- Q1 milestone: 8 pounds by March 31
- Monthly meal prep every Sunday
- If-then plans for common obstacles..."

4. **Marcus** (Accountability Designer) - ~5 minutes

## Commands

Once you start, you can use these commands anytime:

## The 5 Agents

### 1. Maya - Vision Clarifier
Helps you discover what you *actually* want for 2026 through deep questions about motivation, importance, and trade-offs.

### 2. David - Goal Architect  
Transforms your vision into a SMART goal (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) with quarterly milestones.

### 3. Jen - Action Planner
Creates your month-by-month action plan for all 12 months, including specific habits, tasks, and time commitments.

### 4. Marcus - Accountability Designer
Builds your accountability system with tracking methods, social support, obstacle planning, and environmental design.

### 5. Alex - Resolution Finalizer
Synthesizes everything into your final resolution blueprint—a single document with your complete plan.

## Why This Works

### Traditional Resolutions
- Vague goals
- No action plan

- **80% failure rate**

### Resolution Builder Approach  
- Specific, measurable goals
- Month-by-month action plans
- Built-in accountability systems
- Relies on systems, not motivation
- **Dramatically higher success rate**

## FAQ

**Q: How long does this take?**  
A: 20-30 minutes total. It's an investment that pays off all year.

**Q: Do I need technical knowledge?**  
A: No. Just upload the file and type `*start`. The tool guides you through everything.

**Q: Can I use this for multiple resolutions?**  
A: Yes! Either create separate chat sessions, or type `*restart` to start fresh. However, research shows focusing on ONE resolution dramatically increases success rates.

**Q: What if I want to adjust my resolution mid-year?**  
A: Life changes—flexibility is strength. You can return to the tool, jump to specific agents (like `*agent plan`), and revise your plan.

**Q: Which AI platform works best?**  
A: Claude Projects tends to give the most thoughtful, nuanced responses. But all three platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) work well.

**Q: Is this really free?**  
A: Yes. Completely free. No signup, no upsell, no BS. If you use a paid AI platform (like ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro), you'll need that subscription, but the tool itself is free.

**Q: Can I share this with friends?**  
A: Absolutely! Share the GitHub link. Help others succeed too.

## Tips for Success

1. **Be honest** - The tool only works if you're truthful about your constraints, motivation, and capabilities

2. **Take your time** - Don't rush through the questions. The quality of your answers determines the quality of your resolution

3. **Save your blueprint** - Copy it to a document you'll actually reference monthly

4. **Review monthly** - Set a recurring calendar reminder to review your blueprint on the last Sunday of each month

5. **Adjust as needed** - If life changes, update your plan. Rigid plans break; flexible systems adapt

6. **Focus on ONE** - Better to achieve one great resolution than fail at three mediocre ones
